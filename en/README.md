Go system programming
=====================

Go System Programming is a book about how to Linux System Programming in Go. There's many books introduce the basic Go. Like:

- [Go tutorial](http://tour.golang.org/)
- [Learning Go](http://archive.miek.nl/projects/learninggo/index.html)
- [Build web application with golang](http://astaxie.gitbooks.io/build-web-application-with-golang/content/)
- [Learn Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

But I found there's no books introduce Go System Programming these years. Actually Go is the best system language in 21th Century. There's so many system developed by Go. like `Docker`, `etcd`, `consul` etc. It's all related with system programming. But if we want to develop an application related with Linux. There's rarely materials about how to use Go to do the system. Like `Linux IO`, `Socket`, `mmap`, `Lock`, `Thread`, `Process` etc. So I want to write this book to introduce Linux System Programming. I will write this book in Chinese. Later will translate into other languages.
