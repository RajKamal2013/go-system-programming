Go system programming
=====================

Go System Programming is a book about how to Linux System Porgramming in Go. There's many books introduce the basic Go. Like:

- Go tutorial
- Learning Go
- Build web application with golang
- Learn Go By Example

But I found there's no books introduce Go System Programming these years. Actually Go is the best system language in 21th Century. There's so many system developed by Go. like `Docker`, `etcd`, `consul` etc. It's all related with system pragramming. But if we want to develop an application related with Linux. There's rarely materials about how to use Go to do the system. Like `Linux IO`, `Socket`, `mmap`, `Lock`, `Thread`, `Process` etc. So I want to write this book to introduce Linux System Programming. I will wtite this book in Chinese. Later will translate into other languages.
